# race-creator
A Spigot plugin for creating races on your Minecraft server.

Here are the ideas for features for this plugin:
- Lobby functionality--a way to set a central location for races to start
- Player race join functionality
- Player race leave functionality
- Player ready up functionality
- Vote system (?)
- Allow plugin to extend functionality for foot/horse races
- Race start area (/race setstart)
- Initial spawns at start of race (/race setspawn)
- Checkpoints. Should integrate WorldEdit for this. I'm thinking make it possible for two different locations to be used to indicate a single checkpoint (like two posts the racer has to go between).
- Finish area. Similar to making a checkpoint, except indicate that this is the finish line
- MarioKart-like items. The new enchanted arrows make this especially interesting, as well as the ability for two people to sit in the same boat.
- Rewards for the winner of the race (make this optional). Idea: if the players want, they can each put in a tiny percentage of their server money (like .5%) into a pot, and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners win portions of that pot.
